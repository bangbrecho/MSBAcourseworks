# MSc Business Analytics Coursework Projects

This repository contains coursework projects completed as part of my MSc in Business Analytics at Warwick Business School. Each project demonstrates different analytical techniques and methods used to solve business problems. Below are the details of the various projects and their associated codes.

## Projects Overview

### 1. **Decision Trees for Review Prediction (GBDT, RF, XGBoost)**
   - Implemented decision tree models to predict product reviews using different machine learning algorithms.
   - Models used:
     - Gradient Boosted Decision Trees (GBDT)
     - Random Forest (RF)
     - XGBoost
   - Performance evaluation of each model was performed based on various metrics.
   - Groupwork

### 2. **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**
   - Developed an LSTM model for time series forecasting and sequential data analysis.
   - Focus on applying deep learning for predictive tasks in business contexts, such as sales prediction or customer behavior forecasting.

### 3. **Price Optimisation**
   - Implemented optimization algorithms to suggest optimal pricing strategies.
   - Used mathematical models to simulate price elasticity and maximize revenue under certain business constraints.
   - Groupwork

### 4. **R Statistical Testing**
   - Conducted hypothesis testing and statistical analysis using R.
   - Implemented various statistical t-testing   to analyze real-world business data.

### 5. **R Modelling**
   - Built linear modelling in R to understand multicollinearity in data.

### 6. **SQL Employee Report**
   - Created SQL queries to generate an employee report from a company database.
   - The project involves data extraction and aggregation to produce actionable insights about employee performance and workforce trends.

### 7. **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**
   - Developed a RAG system for medical application.

### 8. **A/B Testing**
   - Developed an A/B testing statistical calculation.
   - Groupwork.

### 9. **SVM**
   - Developed an SVM algorithm using linear and nonlinear optimisation.
   - Groupwork.

Note

This repository contains coursework projects completed during my MSc in Business Analytics at Warwick Business School. The code and methodologies are intended to showcase my skills for job applications and should not be considered open-source or production-ready. Feel free to explore the projects as examples of my work and analytical capabilities.

Do not replicate or reuse these projects for commercial purposes or as part of any course or professional work unless explicitly permitted.

Not for commercial distribution â€” these projects should not be used in any production environment or be part of any consulting project.
